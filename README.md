# FilNalyticsApp
A javafx application💡 in form a widget🔧 with drag and drop capability,which does a file analytics on your pc. It searches for empty files, duplicate files and empty directories in your pc then gives you the total of each. Point to note:::For checking whether a file is the same as another ( duplicate ) we read the whole file and make a hash of the contents using MD5 ( you can change this and use any valid hashing algorithm  👐), this way we ensure the algorithm for checking for duplicates is efficient . Hence, depending on the file contents and the number of files in a directory , the time taken to hash the contents of a file  will vary ☺.
